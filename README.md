# CryptoTools ‚Äî Hill Cipher & Cryptanalysis Suite (R) üîê

**CryptoTools** is a hands-on R toolkit for exploring **matrix-based cryptography** (Hill cipher) and **basic cryptanalysis**. Encrypt, decrypt, analyze, and even attempt key recovery ‚Äî all while learning how linear algebra powers modern cryptography.

Perfect for students, hobbyists, or anyone looking to **showcase practical cybersecurity skills** in R.

---

## üöÄ Why This Project Matters
- Connects **linear algebra** with real-world cryptography.
- Demonstrates **modular arithmetic** and **matrix inversion mod 26**.
- Provides **ciphertext analysis tools**: frequency histograms, English similarity scoring, brute-force cracking.
- Fully **ready-to-demo** on GitHub ‚Äî a polished showcase of cryptography and R programming.
